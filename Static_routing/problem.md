Task No. 5: To implementation & test the static routing using GUI and CLI mode.

(a) Objective :-

The objective of this experiment is to implement and verify static routing between multiple networks 
using both the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) modes in Cisco 
Packet Tracer. 

This activity aims to demonstrate how routers can be manually configured with static routes to 
establish communication between different networks without using any dynamic routing protocols. 

By the end of this experiment, users will be able to: 

Configure static routes between routers. 

Assign appropriate IP addresses and subnet masks to interfaces. 

Verify network connectivity using ping and traceroute commands.

Understand the difference between GUI-based and CLI-based configuration methods for routing. 

(b) Network Topology :-
