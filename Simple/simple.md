Q 1. To create & test a simple computer network using IP 
addressing.

(a) Objective :-

The main objective of this experiment is to design, configure, and test a basic computer network 
using proper IP addressing techniques. It aims to help students understand how to assign unique IP 
addresses to different devices such as PCs, switches, and routers to enable communication within a 
network. Through this exercise, learners will gain hands-on experience in creating network 
topologies, configuring IP settings, and verifying connectivity using tools like the ping command in 
Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective also includes understanding how data transmission occurs 
between devices in a local area network (LAN) and ensuring that the assigned IP addresses function 
correctly for smooth communication. 

(b) Network Topology :-

(c) Configuration of different components of network topology :-

1. End Devices (PCs, Laptops, Servers)
   
Purpose: To send and receive data in a network. 

Configuration Steps:

• Click on the PC → go to Desktop tab → IP Configuration. 

• Assign: 

o IP Address: (e.g., 192.168.1.2) 

o Subnet Mask: (e.g., 255.255.255.0) 

o Default Gateway: (e.g., 192.168.1.1) 

• Optionally, set DNS Server if internet simulation is needed. 

2. Switches

Purpose: To connect multiple devices within the same local area network (LAN).

Configuration Steps:

• Usually, no IP configuration is required for basic switching. 

• For management access: 

o Go to CLI tab → Enter configuration mode
