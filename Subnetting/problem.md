 To design & test the subnetting based network 
--

---
(a) Objective :-
-
The objective of this experiment is to design, configure, and test a subnetting-based network in 
Cisco Packet Tracer. The aim is to understand how a large network can be divided into smaller sub
networks (subnets) using subnet masks to optimize IP address utilization and improve network 
performance. 

This experiment focuses on assigning IP addresses through subnetting, configuring network devices 
(such as routers, switches, and PCs), and testing connectivity between subnets using ping or 
traceroute commands. By the end of this experiment, learners will be able to: 

• Perform subnet calculations for a given IP range. 

• Assign appropriate IP addresses and subnet masks. 

• Configure devices according to subnet plans. 

• Verify end-to-end communication between different subnets.

PCs / Laptops 

Set IP and gateway on each end device to the usable address and router interface: 

• Left Laptop: 

o IP: 192.168.10.34 

o Mask: 255.255.255.252 

o Gateway: 192.168.10.33 

• PC: 

o IP: 192.168.10.38

o Mask: 255.255.255.252 

o Gateway: 192.168.10.37 

• Middle Laptop: 

o IP: 192.168.10.42 

o Mask: 255.255.255.252 

o Gateway: 192.168.10.41 

• Right Laptop: 

o IP: 192.168.10.46 

o Mask: 255.255.255.252 

o Gateway: 192.168.10.45
